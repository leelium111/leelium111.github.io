helluliok uwa unasemea the desription box, yeayha so try it
so description box is not so important, the box above it is
exactly
the =
give me an example of how you wirte it 
u dont want to know
sasa the ones ulizonionesha ndo the changes or sijakuelewa
they area called the commit messages, same thing. so yeah. so me too, idk what to write, whatever pops up , i write and push
ahaaaaaa sawa 
hapo it doesnt overwirte the og
it depends, which file you changed
so kama rn, its j this new me n you txt file, so index.html (with all the code) is never affected
sasa what is affected then like where will the changes be visble
just click io push origin
i think i accidentally pressed it, shida ulkuwa hutulii 
sameo
rnee



tulia, so you see now, there are new changes, because github always listens and compares 
aya do the steps again, put a message, the push origin nikisha push origin nitulie
just do it
now open your github

so now we are going to edit, index, you'll see how changes will be reflected
1. usiogope
2. kama una swal uliza onionesha
we go?? sawa

aya, it works the same for functions too
chochote, just any change. so now try committing
